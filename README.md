# üñ§ My Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration optimized for use on Fedora Linux. It includes useful plugins, language server support, and custom keybindings for an efficient development workflow.

## üì¶ Installation (Fedora)

Follow these steps to install and use this configuration on a Fedora system:

### 1. Install Neovim

First, install the latest version of Neovim using DNF:

```bash
sudo dnf install nvim
````

> ‚úÖ This assumes you're using Fedora and `nvim` is available from the default repositories.

### 2. Clone the Configuration

Clone this repo into your Neovim config directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehediuc11/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim/
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `~/.config/nvim/` is empty or backed up before cloning.

### 3. Launch Neovim

Start Neovim:

```bash
nvim
```
